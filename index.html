    <h1>Tayab: The Eternal Protector of Mars</h1>
    <p><em><strong>President</strong> of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/space/mars/@0,55.3897335,13584480m/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAwMi4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">Mars</a></em></p>
    <p>For over a thousand years, President Tayab has ruled Mars, not just as a leader but as its eternal protector. Blessed with incredible magical powers and the wisdom of millennia, Tayab has been locked in a century-long war against ancient demons seeking to plunge Mars into darkness.

       Though these demons are relentless, Tayab's resolve is unbreakable. Wielding magic that can bend reality, he fights every day, vanquishing his foes and keeping Mars safe. Despite the endless battles, his vow remains the same: "I will fight until the last demon falls & I love Cigeretes."
       
       His people know—Mars will never fall as long as Tayab stands.</p>
